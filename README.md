# gtest
Fork of Google Test

At the time this repository was created Google Test release 1.7.0 had a minor issue and trunk did not work with FreeWebOS tests at all. As soon as we get a compatible release this repo should be deprecated.

It is basically release 1.7.0 with some [missing header files](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/source/detail?r=701) added.
